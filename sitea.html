<H1><font color="white" face="Arial"><P>Turning coins into components!
This round is based on the technological aspects of electricity, especially the design and application of circuitry and electronic equipment. The participants will be given one main question which will be related to building a circuit. But to build the circuit they’ll need components, to buy the components they’ll need coins and to earn the coins they need to work, i.e solve the questions. So, they'll be given a set of questions in 2 separate G-forms where each member of the team will have to attend one g-form. Later the team can use the cumulative points as coins to get the components to build their main circuit.</P></H1></font>
