<H1><font color="white" face="arial"><P>Clip and Clamp is a design event based on Digital Electronics. Participants are supposed to design the circuit and simulate the appropriate output. This event serves as a platform to showcase the participants individuality by examining the technical thinking of them. Participate to excite your creative neurons.</P></H1></font>
<H1><font color="green" face="arial"><P>ROUND 1:</P></H1></font>
<H1><font color="white" face="arial"><P>In this round, participants are initially given PDFs in a drive. Each PDF contains a circuit diagram, and the participants are asked to crack the circuit and obtain the output. The first PDF will have no password, whereas the remaining contains a password that is the output of the previous circuit. The last PDF contains a google form to which the participants need to respond.
<br>Participants for Round 2 will be scrutinized based on their responses.</P></H1></font>
<H1><font color="green" face="Arial"><P>ROUND 2: </P></H1></font>
<H1><font color="white" face="Arial"><P>This round is to test design skills and logical thinking. The shortlisted participants will be asked to join the online platform – ‘Zoom’ through breakout room option we will be monitoring the participants. The circuit designing event will be conducted through an online digital circuit designing platform called ‘Circuitverse’.
<br>Participants will be given a circuit with a missing component and an output for the circuit. The participants are expected to find and simulate the circuit in the above-said platform. After completion, participants need to present their output. Winners will be carefully chosen based on their outputs and their rapid designing skills.</P></H1></font>
